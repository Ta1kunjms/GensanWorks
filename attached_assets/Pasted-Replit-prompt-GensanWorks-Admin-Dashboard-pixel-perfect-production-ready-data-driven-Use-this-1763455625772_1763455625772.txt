Replit prompt — GensanWorks Admin Dashboard (pixel-perfect, production-ready, data-driven)

Use this as the single prompt to paste into Replit (or into an AI coding assistant). It must produce a full React + Tailwind app (Vite or Create-React-App) with real components, Chart.js, responsive layout, and a small mock API (local JSON / MSW / simple Express dev server). Important: cards must be data-driven (read from API / context), not hard-coded — but include a seed dataset that reproduces the values in the visual spec so the UI looks identical on first run.

Objective (one-line)

Build a pixel-perfect, responsive Admin Dashboard UI named GensanWorks that matches the supplied visual spec exactly (positions, spacing, typography, colors, icons, shadows, radii, charts, data values and table sample), while being fully functional and data-driven.

Tech stack & setup (must be used)

React (latest)

TypeScript (recommended)

TailwindCSS (for styling) — include tailwind.config with design tokens matching spec

Headless UI / shadcn components optional for accessible components

Chart.js (react-chartjs-2) for bar/doughnut/line charts

React Router (single page admin)

Mock API: json-server or MSW (so cards read from /api/summary, charts from /api/charts, table from /api/referrals)

Icons: Lucide or Bootstrap Icons (stroke style)

Build/responsive target: 1920×1080 layout default, auto-fit down to 1366 / 1024 / 768

Deliverables: runnable Replit project with npm run dev, README with run instructions, and a single seed-data.json file

Generate Report (green pill: #12B76A, white text)

Summary cards — data-driven (seed provided)

Important: cards must read values from /api/summary. Provide a default seed that yields the following values visually — but code should accept arbitrary responses.

Seed (/api/summary sample):

{
  "totalApplicants": { "value": 1318, "change": 4.2, "trend": "up" },
  "activeEmployers": { "value": 119, "change": 1.2, "trend": "up" },
  "activeJobPosts": { "value": 36, "change": -2.6, "trend": "down" },
  "pendingEmployerFeedback": { "value": 13, "change": 7.8, "trend": "up" },
  "successfulReferrals": { "value": 713, "change": 52.7, "trend": "up" },
  "activeFreelancers": { "value": 47, "change": 3.1, "trend": "up" }
}


Card visuals:

Number (large), underneath change with caret / arrow: green with #12B76A when trend: "up", red #F04438 when down.

Use small sparkline inside each card matching the change direction (optional but included).

Recent Activities (right column card)

Seed (/api/recent-activities):

[
  "New applicant from Labangal registered",
  "Employer ABC posted 3 new vacancies",
  "Referral slip issued to Maria Santos"
]


Bullet list inside card, timestamp optional

Title: Recent Activities

Charts — exact datasets & visuals

1) Applicants by Barangay — Bar Chart

X labels: barangays A → Z (use realistic barangay names if desired, but label pattern must match A..Z)

Y axis: 0–100

Two series per barangay:

Job Seeker (black stroke/fill)

Freelancer (blue fill #2E7FFB)

Use the seed to create the bar heights so bars are taller in mid letters — provide explicit array in /api/charts/bar.

Legend at top-left inside card (small icons).

Seed example:

{
  "barangays": ["A", "B", "C", ..., "Z"],
  "jobSeeker": [12, 20, 18, 25, 70, 80, 90, 85, 78, 66, 60, 58, 50, 48, 45, 40, 35, 30, 28, 26, 22, 18, 15, 12, 10, 8],
  "freelancer": [1,2,1,0,3,4,5,4,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
}


2) Jobseeker vs Freelancer — Doughnut Chart

Outer ring dark background, inner ring white cutout

Values: Job Seeker: 96.43% → 1271 ; Freelancer: 3.57% → 47

Side labels: show exact counts and percent. Use /api/charts/doughnut seed with those values.

Seed:

{"jobSeeker": 1271, "freelancer": 47}


3) Monthly Referrals Trend — Line Chart

Months JAN → DEC (x)

Three series:

Referred (orange)

Hired (green #12B76A)

Feedback (blue #2E7FFB)

Provide data with ups & downs that visually match reference; seed in /api/charts/line.

Seed (example):

{
 "months":["JAN","FEB","MAR","APR","MAY","JUN","JUL","AUG","SEP","OCT","NOV","DEC"],
 "referred":[120,130,110,140,150,160,170,155,140,130,125,135],
 "hired":[40,45,50,55,60,90,100,95,80,75,70,85],
 "feedback":[10,12,11,14,20,25,30,28,20,18,17,22]
}


Rendering notes

Chart axes, gridlines, fonts must match Inter face and exact colors.

Doughnut inner background white ring; outer background dark ring for contrast.

Referral & Placement Summary table (bottom)

Title: Referral & Placement Summary

Filters on right: Barangay, Employer, Job Category, Date range, Status, and a green pill Export to CSV button

Table columns (exact order):

Referral ID

Applicant

Vacancy

Employer

Date Referred

Status (with colored dot)

Feedback

Actions (icons)

Sample row must appear exactly (from /api/referrals seed):

{
  "referralId":"RFL-2025-0112",
  "applicant":"Ren Paulo Galas",
  "vacancy":"Office Staff",
  "employer":"Jaro Construction & Supply",
  "dateReferred":"2025-10-27",
  "status":"Hired",
  "statusColor":"#12B76A",
  "feedback":"Excellent fit — already started on Nov 2.",
  "actions":["view","message","generateSlip"]
}


Actions icons: Eye, Message, Document+Plus — clickable; implement handlers:

view opens modal with referral details,

message opens quick feedback/request modal,

generateSlip downloads PDF (generate simple PDF client-side with jsPDF or create printable HTML).

Accessibility & behavior

All interactive elements keyboard-focusable and labeled (aria-*)

Color contrast must meet AA for primary text

Sidebar: focus trap when collapsed; top nav: accessible search

Table: sortable columns (at least Referral ID, Date Referred, Status)

Mobile: sidebar collapses to top drawer; grid turns into single column with charts stacked

Data binding & mock API rules (MANDATORY)

All UI values must be read from the mock API endpoints:

GET /api/summary

GET /api/recent-activities

GET /api/charts/bar

GET /api/charts/doughnut

GET /api/charts/line

GET /api/referrals?limit=...&filters=...

App should gracefully handle empty states and show skeletons while loading

Provide a seed-data.json with the exact values above so the app looks identical on first load

Provide README instructions for switching mock API to static build or remote API

Pixel-perfect details (must be obeyed)

Card border-radius 16px; all card paddings and line-heights must mimic reference

Typography scale: Title 18–20px semibold; card numbers 28–36px bold; small captions 12–14px

Use Tailwind utilities with custom tokens to reproduce spacing exactly

Buttons/pills: exact colors and radii; Generate Report is green pill

Shadows and subtle separators must match spec

Code structure & deliverables

/src

/components (Sidebar, TopNav, SummaryCard, Charts, Table, Modals, Filters, Buttons)

/api (mock client + types)

/pages/Dashboard.tsx

/styles (tailwind config + theme tokens)

seed-data.json (above samples)

README.md with run + build instructions and how to update seed data

LICENSE (MIT)

tests (optional): one integration test to assert summary values render from API

Quality checks (CI dev checklist)

On npm run dev, app boots at http://localhost:3000 and shows Dashboard Overview at 1920×1080 exactly like the spec.

All summary cards populated from /api/summary.

Doughnut shows exact 96.43% / 3.57% with counts 1271 / 47.

Table contains sample row RFL-2025-0112 and action icons work.

Charts use Chart.js and match seeded shapes/patterns.

Responsive breakpoints: 1920, 1366, 1024, 768 — components collapse gracefully.

Export to CSV produces a file with current filtered rows.

Accessibility: aria labels present; keyboard navigation works.

Extra developer notes (do this, do not ask)

Make everything componentized and themeable (avoid magic numbers in CSS — use tokens).

Provide hooks/useSummary.ts etc. for fetching and caching.

Use react-query or equivalent to fetch and cache API responses for performance.

Provide a single ThemeProvider so color tokens can be easily tuned.

Provide a single constants/ui.ts storing the exact hex values and spacing used above.

For Replit: include .replit and replit.nix if necessary to auto-run dev server.

Copyable prompt to paste into Replit

Build a React + TypeScript + Tailwind admin dashboard called GensanWorks that is pixel-perfect and data-driven. Follow the full spec below exactly: [paste the whole spec above — tokens, layout, colors, dataset seeds, endpoints, file structure, accessibility checklist, and deliverables]. Create a mock API (json-server / MSW) with seed-data.json containing the seed values shown. All cards, charts and the table must read from the mock API endpoints. Use Chart.js for charts and Lucide icons for minimal stroke icons. Ensure sidebar behavior, top nav, buttons, card radii (16px), shadows, fonts (Inter), exact colors, and the sample table row (RFL-2025-0112) appear. Include README with run instructions and tests. Output a ready-to-run Replit project.
